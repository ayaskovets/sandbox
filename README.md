# This repo is an official sink for the garbage collector of my pet projects

There is a lot of stuff with varying degree of complexity and usefulness here. The sub-folders are self-contained and do not share anything but creator. Each project has got its own bit of description below. The repo is both a reminder of passed glory and a motivational letter to myself
